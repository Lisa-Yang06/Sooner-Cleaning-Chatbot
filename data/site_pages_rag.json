    "title": "How to calculate the gram weight of non-woven fabrics? -",
    "text": "How to calculate the gram weight of non-woven fabrics?\nThe price differences of different types of non-woven fabrics are mainly in terms of material, process, gram weight, color, special width, etc. Only by knowing the specific gram weight (thickness), width, color, quantity, and roll length of non-woven fabrics can the standard net weight and total price of each roll of fabric be accurately calculated. Non-woven fabrics have different thicknesses and advantages. In order to accurately calculate the price of non-woven fabrics, it is generally necessary to accurately calculate the gram weight of non-woven fabrics. Calculation method of gram weight of non-woven fabrics Gram weight refers to the gram weight per square meter, that is, grams/square meter. 68gsm cloth refers to 68 grams/square meter, which means that the weight of one square meter is 68 grams, which is used to measure and distinguish the thickness of the fabric. Gram weight is used to calculate the thickness of non-woven products. Why not use millimeters? In fact, millimeters are also used, but they are rarely used. This is an industry rule for easy calculation. In fact, square weight is equivalent to millimeters in thickness. The regular weight of non-woven fabrics is between 10g/㎡ and 320g/㎡. Some needle-punched fabrics can achieve thicker weights. In addition to non-woven fabrics, the calculation methods of other Oxford bags, nylon bags, cotton bags, and canvas bags are similar, but the units are different. How to measure the weight of non-woven fabrics? To calculate the weight of non-woven fabrics, there are special measuring tools, cutters and electronic scales in the industry. The measurement method is as follows: 1. Cut a small piece of non-woven fabric and fold it in half several times; 2. Use a cutting tool to cut out pieces of cloth of the same size (round or square); 3. Weigh the weight of each piece, add the total weight and divide it by the quantity (this is more uniform and accurate); Due to the non-woven fabric industry, the production process and technology of each factory are different, and the weight produced is biased. For example, if the order specification is 70gsm, not every piece will be exactly 70gsm after weighing. Generally, we try to control it within the gram weight deviation range allowed by the industry. Depending on the material and thickness of different types of non-woven fabrics, the gram weight of non-woven fabrics is also different. Each non-woven fabric manufacturer has similar calculation methods for the gram weight of different types of non-woven fabrics.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Processing methods of bio-based chemical fibers"

    "text": "Non-woven wipes vs. traditional wipes: 6 major advantages\nCompared to traditional materials such as cotton yarn and rags, non-woven wipes are reshaping industrial cleaning standards with technological innovation: 1. Cleaning efficiency revolution Water and oil absorption: Non-woven fabrics have a liquid absorption rate 2-3 times that of traditional wipes. For example, microfiber cloth can absorb 10 times its own weight of oil, while cotton cloth can only absorb 3 times. Decontamination ability: Special embossed design (such as honeycomb pattern) increases the cleaning contact area by 40%, and can penetrate 0.1mm gaps to remove particles. 2. Hygiene and safety upgrade Antibacterial performance: Medical-grade non-woven fabrics have passed ISO 10993 biocompatibility certification, with bacterial residues <100 CFU/g, while traditional wipes have a bacterial content of more than 1 million CFU/g after one week of use. Cross-contamination: Disposable non-woven fabrics are disposable, avoiding the risk of pathogen transmission caused by repeated use. 3. Economic breakthrough Service life: High-strength polyester non-woven fabric can be reused more than 50 times, while the average service life of cotton fabric is only 10 times. Comprehensive cost: After a certain automobile factory switched to non-woven fabric, the annual cleaning consumables cost dropped by 28%, and the manual cleaning time was reduced by 40%. 4. Environmental compliance Degradable materials: Bio-based non-woven fabrics (such as polylactic acid PLA) can be completely degraded within 180 days, while traditional chemical fiber rags take more than 500 years. Carbon footprint optimization: The use of recycled polyester non-woven fabrics can reduce carbon emissions by 62% compared to traditional processes. 5. Scene adaptation capability Smart device compatibility: The high-density flow-guiding layer design is adapted to the automatic towel dispensing machine, 1 roll of non-woven fabric = the traditional 3 rolls, and 200+ commercial projects have been implemented. Customized service: Supports flexible customization of weight (35-130gsm), width (10-320cm), and embossed texture, and proofing can be completed in 3 days. 6. Global certification endorsement International standards: Passed INDA/EDANA GD4, OEKO-TEX and other certifications, meeting the cross-border procurement requirements of Amazon, Walmart and other companies. Industry case: 3M and other leading brands have used non-woven fabrics as core raw materials, driving the industry's annual compound growth rate to 19.3%.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Materials and application scenarios of industrial cleaning wipes"

    "text": "Are the flushable wipes really flushable? Performance evaluation of flushable wipes\nHow to evaluate the flushability of wet wipes? INDA (North American Nonwovens Association) and EDANA (European Nonwovens Association) updated the evaluation method for flushable disposable nonwoven wipes in the Flushability Evaluation Guide (4th Edition) released in 2018. The guide contains a total of 7 flushability evaluation tests to test the flushability and biodegradability of products. Only after passing these 7 tests can it be called a \"flushable product\", which are toilet and sewer clearance test, shaking box decomposition test, household pump test, sedimentation test, aerobic biodegradation/biodegradation test, anaerobic biodegradation/biodegradation test, and municipal sewage pump test. 1. Toilet and sewer clearance test Used to detect whether the wet wipes can be flushed down the toilet and whether there is a possibility of clogging the toilet and sewer. The test system consists of a toilet and a sewer pipe, simulating a family of four using the toilet normally for 2 consecutive days and at least 3 times a day, and flushing the toilet 35 times in the order of flushing only water, flushing only wet wipes, and flushing wet wipes and simulated feces. The condition for passing this test is that the distance between the center of mass of the additive should not continue to decrease when flushing for 5 consecutive times without using other tools such as toilet plungers. 2. Shaking box decomposition test It is used to test the decomposition performance of wet wipes products when they are physically shaken in tap water or wastewater. The specific operation is as follows: First, place the non-woven wet wipes sample in a shaking box filled with 2 L of tap water. After shaking at a certain frequency and amplitude for 60 minutes, transfer the sample to a porous sieve with an aperture of 12.5 mm, collect the sample left on the porous sieve and weigh it, and calculate the percentage of the dry weight ratio of the sample on the sieve to the original sample. The condition for passing this test is that in the sample test, at least 5 samples have a decomposition rate greater than 70%. China's new flushability test for disposable sanitary nonwoven materials stipulates that the dry cloth shakes in a shaking box for 10 minutes, and the decomposition rate level exceeds 90%; the wet wipes shake in a shaking box for 60 minutes, and the decomposition rate level exceeds 70%. 3. Household pump test It is used to test whether wet wipes will have an impact on household sewage pumps and sewage systems. The test consists of a toilet, a sewer pipe and a sewage pump. By simulating the frequency of toilet use by a family of four, toilet paper and wet wipes samples are added for flushing according to the prescribed procedure (see Table 1). The test lasts for 6 days, with 2 test sequences per day, and each sequence is flushed 12 times. The condition for passing the test is that the average amount of wet wipes samples remaining from the 2nd to the 6th day cannot exceed the amount of samples added per day.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: How are flushable wet wipes made?

    "title": "Preparation process of degradable wet wipes -",
    "text": "Preparation Process of Degradable Wet Wipes\nThe preparation process of degradable wet wipes mainly includes textile process, wet wipes process and packaging process. The specific process flow can be adjusted according to different materials and wet wipes product requirements. Generally speaking, the preparation process includes fiber preparation, spinning, weaving, coating, cutting, packaging and other links. During the preparation process, attention should be paid to controlling the moisture content and moisture content of wet wipes, adding an appropriate amount of wet moisturizer, etc., to improve the stability and use experience of the product. When selecting materials, choose biodegradable materials and process the materials into a fiber state, which can be done through textile technology, spinning technology, etc.; you can use wet-laid or dry-laid technology to prepare the materials into fibers yarn. Wet laying includes three stages: dispersing fiber raw materials, fiber web shaping and drying. During production, the fibers are first dissolved in water according to a certain proportion, then beaten into a slurry with a beater, and then the slurry is evenly distributed. Apply it on the mesh curtain and dry it to form a fiber mesh. Fibers suitable for wet-laid webs are required to have good dispersion in water. If the fibers are not well dispersed in water and form kinks in the water and are not easy to become single fibers, it will greatly reduce the efficiency of wet-laid webs. quality. The dispersibility of fibers in water is affected by factors such as their aspect ratio, curl, and hygroscopicity. To improve the dispersion rate of fibers in water, surfactants can be added to water for hydrophilic treatment. Dry-laid webs include carded webs and air-laid webs. The carded web-laid method has higher fiber length requirements, while the production of wet wipes requires a certain content of short fibers to maintain its flushability. The product is not highly dispersible and will be gradually eliminated from the market. The airlaid method does not have high requirements on the length of long fibers and can be used to process short fibers with a length less than 80 mm, especially wood pulp fibers with a length less than 10 mm, and has the advantage of relatively low production costs. The fibers produced by the above method also need to go through the reinforcement process to keep the wet wipes in good wet strength. The reinforcement mainly includes chemical bonding, thermal bonding, and spunlace. The chemical bonding method is to coat a layer of reinforcing agent on the surface. The reinforcing agent can be a water-soluble polymer, adhesive or resin, etc., which forms a thin film by coating and drying, thereby increasing the strength and stability of the wet wipes. The thermal bonding method is to add a hot pressing adhesive to the fiber, and then use a certain temperature and pressure for hot pressing to melt the hot pressing adhesive between the fibers, thereby enhancing its strength and stability. The spunlace method uses high-pressure water flow to perform spunlace. Different materials and fibers are alternately layered together to strengthen the fiber web. These reinforcement processes can be adjusted and combined according to different wet wipe materials and product requirements. Through appropriate reinforcement processes, the strength and durability of wet wipes can be improved, their service life can be extended, and the fragmentation of wet wipes can be reduced to a certain extent, and the degradation rate can be slowed down. In the process of preparing biodegradable wipes, the following aspects need to be paid attention to. 1. Humidity and moisture content of wet wipes: Control the humidity and moisture content of wet wipes to maintain the stability of wet wipes and slow down the degradation rate of wet wipes. 2. Selection and use of additives: According to the function and needs of wet wipes, appropriate additives should be selected, such as moisturizers, antibacterial agents, etc. The selection of additives should meet environmental protection requirements . 3. Product safety: The safety of the product should be ensured during the preparation process, such as disinfection treatment, quality inspection, etc. Through reasonable process design and material selection, biodegradable wet wipes can be naturally decomposed into harmless substances within a certain period of time, reducing the negative impact on the environment.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: What are the materials of biodegradable wet wipes?"

    "text": "How to choose biodegradable wipes? Performance evaluation of biodegradable wipes\nHow to choose biodegradable wet wipes? You can evaluate the performance of biodegradable wipes from the following aspects： Degradation rate of wet wipes The degradation performance of wet wipes can be evaluated by the degradation rate of wet wipes in the natural environment. This can be evaluated by observing the degradation of wet wipes under different environmental conditions, such as the decomposition rate in soil, the dissolution rate in water, etc. The sedimentation test can be used to evaluate whether wet wipes can settle in a sewage pit or septic tank. The specific method is to place the treated sample in a transparent tube with a diameter of 20cm filled with tap water and observe the sedimentation rate of the sample to determine its sedimentation performance. Biodegradability of raw materials The degradation performance of biodegradable wet wipes is closely related to the materials used. When evaluating the degradation performance of biodegradable wet wipes, the biodegradability of raw materials can be considered. Under certain conditions, the degree of degradation of the materials used within a certain period of time is tested. Environmental impact assessment When evaluating the degradation performance of biodegradable wet wipes, the degree of their impact on the environment can be considered. The impact of biodegradable wet wipes on soil, water and other environments can be evaluated by conducting field or laboratory experiments under specific environmental conditions. Product performance retention In addition to degradation performance, the performance retention of biodegradable wipes during use can also be evaluated. The tensile strength, water absorption, antibacterial properties, etc. of the wet wipes can be tested to evaluate whether their performance during use is affected by degradation. International standards and certifications The degradation performance of biodegradable wipes can be evaluated by referring to relevant international standards and certifications, such as biodegradable plastic certification and biodegradable material evaluation. Some international organizations and institutions also have relevant test methods and standards for reference. By comprehensively considering the above aspects, the degradation performance of biodegradable wipes can be comprehensively evaluated. Such an evaluation can help consumers choose biodegradable wipes products that are more in line with environmental protection requirements and prompt manufacturers to continuously improve the degradation performance of products.\nHow to choose biodegradable wet wipes?

    "text": "What are the hazards of wet wipes raw materials? To produce safe wet wipes products\nAccording to market research, wet wipes base fabric spunlace non-woven fabric is the main factor that determines the effect of wet wipes and ultimately affects consumers' purchase and use. The performance evaluation of wet wipes base materials by manufacturers includes basic performance (surface density, thickness, porosity and mechanical properties), comfort (breathability, moisture permeability and softness), and functionality (liquid carrying rate, permeability, water retention rate and antibacterial properties), while there is very little research on toxic and harmful substances that may exist in wet wipes base non-woven fabrics, and safety considerations are almost ignored. So, where are the safety risks of spunlace non-woven fabrics, the raw materials of wet wipes, roughly from? 1. Residual toxic and harmful substances in the raw materials of wet wipes base fabrics In addition to natural fibers such as cotton fibers, organic solvents or heavy metal ion aqueous solutions are used in the production and processing of non-natural fibers such as regenerated cellulose fibers commonly used in wet wipes base fabrics. Therefore, a small amount of toxic and harmful substances that are irritating to the skin may remain in the raw materials of spunlace base fabrics. 2. Chemical additive pollution during wet wipe production process In the spunlace production process of wet wipe substrate, chemical additives such as softeners, stiffeners, hydrophilic agents, finishing additives, antistatic agents, whitening agents, penetrants, special bactericides for spunlace, spunlace needle plate cleaning agents, defoaming agents, etc. can be added according to actual needs. They are often used to improve the stability of wet wipe base fabrics and facial mask base fabrics in the production process and improve product quality. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the type and equivalent of added chemical additives and the degree of pollution of wet wipe base fabrics and facial mask base fabrics. 3. Accelerate the exudation and migration of toxic and harmful substances during circulation and storage Wet wipes and facial masks contain a variety of oily ingredients such as moisturizers, thickeners, emulsifiers, preservatives, and flavors and fragrances. They are weakly acidic and have a shelf life of 2 to 3 years. During long-term storage, it may accelerate the exudation and migration of toxic and harmful substances and chemical additives in the mask base fabric, which will have a certain impact on the safety of mask use. 4. Plastic pollution to the environment Many wet wipes raw materials contain plastic fibers (such as polyester), which are not easy to degrade and cause long-term pollution to the environment. They may accumulate in the environment, forming microplastics, which have a negative impact on ecosystems and organisms.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: The hygroscopic effect of spunlace nonwovens in surgical instrument sterilization packaging"

    "text": "What are the patterns of spunlace nonwoven fabrics?\nSpunlace nonwovens are a kind of fabric that sprays high-pressure fine water flow onto one or more layers of fiber webs to entangle the fibers with each other, so that the fiber web is reinforced and has the strength of spunlace nonwovens. The fabric obtained after this reinforcement is spunlace nonwovens. The principle of reinforcing the fiber web by spunlace is similar to the needle punching process, but instead of using needles, multiple fine water jets generated by high pressure are used - spunlace machines spray the fiber web. After the water jet passes through the fiber web, it is supported by the rebound of the net curtain and interspersed with the fiber web again. As a result, the fibers in the fiber web are displaced, interspersed, entangled and embraced under the hydraulic action of high-speed water jets interspersed in different directions, so that the fiber web is reinforced. So what are the common patterns of spunlace nonwovens? Below we will show the fabric patterns of nonwovens according to the types of spunlace nonwovens. 1.White Viscose&Polyester spunlace nonwoven fabric/Biodegradable spunlace nonwoven fabric\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: What are the hazards of wet wipes raw materials?

Wet wipes have gradually become an indispensable cleaning and hygiene product in people's lives. Especially since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia, the usage of cleaning, hygiene and disinfection wipes has increased rapidly. As the use of disposable sanitary products continues to increase, while they bring healthy and convenient life to people, they also slowly bring about some environmental problems. The annual consumption of wet wipes places a huge burden on the environment. Especially since the invention and marketization of wet toilet wipes, how to better adapt to usage scenarios and comply with the requirements of municipal sewage facilities such as drainage pipes has become a focus of the market. This has also affected the flushability and flushability of flushable wet wipes products. Indicators such as degradability have put forward higher requirements.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: The 134th Canton Fair was successfully concluded"

    "text": "The Development Trend Of Spunlace Nonwoven For Wet Wipes\nThe unprecedented demand for disinfecting products in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic made it an extraordinary year for wet wipes.\nIn 2020, both consumers and industrial/institutional users increased their rate of disinfecting wipe usage in order to reduce the infection rate of viruses as much as possible. And in 2021, lots of industrial/institutional users which were shut down or at reduced operating rates because of the Covid-19 pandemic are re-opening (such as schools, restaurants, commercial buildings, janitorial services), the usage rate of disinfecting wipes has not yet slowed.\nThough it ’ s not sure if the demand for wet wipes like we did at the height of the pandemic anytime soon, it can be determined that consumers more than ever understand the value and convenience of these products in everyday life . So now, many people's purchase of wet wipes is not just a “panic buy ”. They can better take care of their families and home s by using cleaning and disinfecting wipes, so they are sustained interest in such products. So demand will remain high at least in recent years .\nThis high demand prompted wipes manufacturers to expand their production. According to the American Cleaning Institute (ACI), the second quarter of 2021 saw a much greater availability of cleaning and disinfecting wipes at local supermarkets and retailers, certainly as compared to much of 2020.\nAccording to the wet wipes market, we can clearly judge the market trend of spunlace nonwoven . As the raw material of the wet wipes, the total global demand for the spunlace nonwoven fabric is also increasing.\nAccording to technology, price and combine the needs of the public, spunlace nonwoven fabric manufacturers usually choose viscose/PET spunlace nonwoven fabric to make wet wipes which is made of viscose and polyester fibers as raw materials. Viscose fiber has the characteristics of strong, hydrophilic, soft, skin-friendly, low lint and meets the needs of human skin, while polyester fiber has a high strength. The combination of two kinds of fibers not only retain the advantages of viscose fiber but also improves the strength and structural stability of the product. Spunlace viscose/PET nonwoven fabric is soft, skin-friendly, super absorbent, low lint, anti-bacterial and solvent resistance. These characteristics make it a great choice for wet wipes material. It can be made in different colors and various types such as plain, mesh, embossed and printed according to the needs of customers.\nHowever, the large-scale use of disposable sanitary products undoubtedly brings a huge burden to the environment. Sustainability was on the back burner at the height of the pandemic as households prioritized safety and hygiene. As we move through the new normal and hopefully out of the pandemic phase, sustainability will emerge front and center for home care items meaning that wipes must either adapt to environment or somehow earn themselves a ‘ pass ’ in the mind of the regulator, brands and consumers.D riven by new directions in sustainability, new markets opening up after the pandemic and new legislation , spunlace nonwoven fabric is entering a new era. Spunlace nonwoven fabric manufacturers are also seeking new programs to meet environmental standards and consumers' continuous demand. On this basis, biodegradable material quickly enters our vision.\nAs an excellent biodegradable fiber, viscose is used in the production of spunlace nonwoven fabric-Viscose Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric and Wood Pulp Viscose Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric. Because of their features of high liquid absorption, low lint, skin-friendly and solvent resistance, they can also be used in wet wipes. Most important of all, they are also environmentally friendly and biodegradable and the concept of green development is well implemented.Under the theme of \"Going Greener\" , this type of spunlace nonwoven fabrics will gradually become the primary choice of consumers.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Biodegradable Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric"

    "text": "What Is Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric\nDo you know what spunlace nonwoven fabric is? Spunlace nonwoven fabric is one of many nonwoven fabrics. Everyone may feel unfamiliar to hear the name, but in fact, we often use spunlace nonwoven products in our daily life, such as wet towels, cleaning wipes, disposable face towels, facial mask paper, etc. This article I will introduce spunlace nonwoven fabrics in detail .\n1. The Process Of Spunlaced Nonwoven Fabric Nonwoven fabric is a kind of fabric that does not need to be woven. It just arranges polypropylene, polyester and other fiber materials directed or randomly to form a fiber net structure, and then uses mechanical ， chemical or thermal bonding methods to reinforce them. Simply speaking, it is the bonding of fibers directly together, but it’s not interwoven and knit together by yarns. Therefore, when we get the nonwoven fabric, we will find that it has no warp and weft threads, and the thread residues can not be drawn out. It is easier to cut, sew and shape. Nonwoven fabric has the characteristics of short process flow, wide source of raw materials, fast production rate, low cost, high output, multiple product types, and wide application. It can also be made into cloths with different thickness, hand feeling and hardness ccording to requirements. Nonwoven fabric not only breaks through the traditional textile principle, but also provides a lot of convenience for our lives.\nNonwoven fabric can be divided into wet process nonwoven fabric and dry process nonwoven fabric according to the manufacturing process. The wet profess refers to the final formation of nonwoven fabric is in water. The process is usually used in papermaking. The dry profess refers to the final formation of nonwoven fabric is in the air,which including heat seal ( meltblown, spunbond, thermal bonding ), needle-punching, spunlace, chemical bonding, stichbond, etc.\nAmong them, spunlace nonwoven fabric refers to a nonwoven fabric made with spunlace process, and the water thorn machine produces a high-pressure water needle (using high-pressure multi-strand fine water jet) to jet the web. After the high-pressure water needle passes through the web, shoot it onto the contained metal mesh conveyor belt, and as the mesh enclosure bounces,the water spatters through it again, which continuously puncture, spread, and use hydraulic to make fibers generate displacement, inserted, entangled, and huddle, thereby reinforcing the web to form a strong, uniform spunlace thin fiber web. The resulting fabric is the spunlace nonwoven fabric.\nNowadays, as the technology continues to mature, new products are constantly emerging, and the market application areas continue to expand, showing its broad development prospects.\n2. Spunlace Nonwoven Production Line The production process of the Spunlace nonwoven fabric is : Feeding Cotton → Opening→ Carding→Lapping→Spunlace→ Drying→ Winding\nFeeding cotton: put different ratio of fiber raw materials into equipment. Opening: High-power blower blows the fiber raw materials to disperse the large fiber block, the fiber group, and make it fluffy. Carding: The prepared fibers are combed into thin webs of single fiber to ready for lapping. Lapping: The thin web reciprocates on a web curtain, and the web is laid in an orderly manner. Spunlace nonwoven fabric has three lapping ways: parallel lapping, cross lapping and random lapping.\nSpunlace: high-pressure water needles make orderly fibers generate displacement, inserted, entangled, and huddle. Drying: Remove water and volatile substances of the cloth, dry the wet surface. Winding: Wind the finished nonwoven fabrics into rolls.\n3. The Composition Of Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric\nSpunlace nonwoven fabric has a wide range of fiber raw materials, which can be polyester, nylon, polypropylene, viscose fiber, chitin fiber, superfine fiber, lyocell, silk, bamboo fiber, woodpulp fiber, seaweed fiber, etc. At present, the four most widely used materials in the market are viscose fiber, woodpulp fiber, polyester and polypropylene.\n·Viscose Fiber Viscose fiber is a kind of cellulose fiber, using \"wood\" as the raw material, extracting and reshaping the fiber molecules from natural wood cellulose to obtain cellulose fiber. In detail, viscose is made of natural fiber (wood fiber, cotton linters) as raw materials, and is made by soluble cellulose xanthate through alkalization, aging, sulfonation and other processes, and then dissolved in dilute lye and subjected to wet method spinning to make viscose. Viscose fiber has good water absorption, and meets the needs of human skin with the characteristics of refreshing, breathable, anti-static, anti-ultraviolet, good dyeing fastness, and biodegradability. It not only has the essence of cotton but also the quality of silk, which is originate from nature and superior to nature. At present, viscose is widely used in various nonwoven fields such as wet wipes, face towels, and rags.\n·Woodpulp Fiber Woodpulp fiber is a kind of fiber made of woodpulp as raw material, but it is different from ordinary plant fiber. It is a secondary fiber, it is a product separated from the original wood fiber, and it is mostly used in the textile field. Because it is mainly extracted from woodpulp, we call it woodpulp fiber, which is similar to paper pulp.Wood pulp fiber has high liquid absorption and it is biodegradable.\n·Polyester Polyester was invented in 1941. It is a synthetic fiber obtained by spinning polyester formed by polycondensation of organic dibasic acid and glycol, referred to as PET fiber. It is a polymer compound and is currently the largest variety of synthetic fibers. It has high strength and elastic recovery ability, good wrinkle resistance and shape retention, at the same time it has good heat resistance, water absorption and oil absorption, strong and durable. Due to its characteristics, polyester is widely used in textile and nonwoven fields, mainly used as raw materials of wet wipes, cleaning wipes, and clothing.\n·Polypropylene Polypropylene refers to synthetic fiber named isotactic polypropylene fiber made from propylene, a by-product of petroleum refining, non-biodegradable. It has light weight but high strength, excellent wear resistance and elastic recovery, chemical resistance is better than most fibers, and has anti-bacterial, safe and sanitary characteristics. Not only that, polypropylene is resistant to oil stains, easy to wash and dry, it is widely used in the field of oily cleaning wipes.\n4. Product Classification Of Spunlace Nonwoven Fabrics\nBased on years of market development and comprehensive application feedback in various fields, currently the most used spunlace nonwovens on the market can be divided into four categories: spunlace viscose & PET nonwoven fabric, spunlace woodpulp & PET nonwoven fabric, spunlace woodpulp & PP nonwoven fabric and biodegradable material. The four types of spunlace nonwoven materials are widely used in industrial wipes, civil wipes, medical materials, beauty nonwoven materials and other fields.\n· Viscose & PET Spunlace Nonwoven Fabric Spunlace viscose & PET nonwoven fabric is made of viscose fiber and polyester as raw materials, and can be made in any ratio from 100% viscose to 100% polyester.

More than any other product we sell, it's these amazing little cloths designed to use with toner and quite honestly, anything that you would normally use with a cotton ball.\nSo I thought I would do a visual comparison so you can see for yourself why these Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads are such a sought-after product.\nHere's how they are different from cotton balls and cotton wool pads (rounds or squares).\nUltra thin for less product waste. As you can see from the photo, they are certainly much thinner than cotton balls, but even a lot thinner than a cotton wool pad. So why does this benefit you? Well, this means that you have less product waste so you save money. You’ll use about 75% less product than a cotton ball and about 40% less from a cotton pad…\nLess bulky for easier use. Particularly with cotton balls, they are hard to glide against the skin because they fall apart when they are wet. Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads stay put in your fingers and are easy to manage.\nNo fuzz or shredding cotton fibers. Since Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads is not 100% cotton, they don't leave fuzz everywhere when applied to the face. This makes cotton wool pads ideal for contact lens wearers who can't get any anything in their eyes and for men with facial hair that don't want to leave any white cotton behind on their skin.\nExtremely gentle on the skin. Cotton fibers can feel scratchy and irritating on thin, sensitive skins, but not our Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads. They feel very soft and gentle when they glide across the skin.\nSimply put, you'll never go back to cotton again. You can use them for anything you would normally use with a cotton ball — from nail polish remover to eye makeup remover.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Wish You a Happy New Year - Kung Hai Fat Choy!"

    "title": "Do you really know how to choose the right baby wipes? -",
    "text": "Do you really know how to choose the right baby wipes?\nMothers often worry about baby allergies, especially after buying new diapers, when the baby shows a red butt, mothers immediately conclude that these diapers must be fakes, and demand for returns strongly. But the red butt may not be caused by diapers, but the wet tissues . Now, let's take a look at the things you should pay attention to when choosing baby wipes.\nProblem 1: It is good wet tissues with a large amount of liquid\nWet tissue with a large amount of liquid can remove impurities better, and eliminating the tedious process of cleaning with clean water.\nExcessive liquid can easily breed bacteria, and less liquid has a bad effect on cleaning. A good wet tissue should has a moderate humidity, and liquit of each slice is suitable for use at one time.\nThere is a famous wet wipes production line in Japan, The final line of the assembly line is an electronic scale, and all the packaged product must be unified weighing, regarding these products which are less than 10 g or more than 30 g as defective goods, only the wet wipes with reasonable weighing can be packing sealing.\nProblem 2: More thicker more better\nThe thick wet tissue is not easily to rip, and it can be used many times,  which also can absorb more liquid.\nSolution: There is no relationship between thickness and pulling property, but the material is the key factors that if it can be torn off easily or not. Baby's skin is very sensitive, and too thick and hard wet tissue may cause skin damage and irritation. Moderate thickness and soft baby wipes can be a good choice.\nProblem 3: There is no differences among these wet tissues, why not pick one casually?\nThe wet tissue with \"baby\" looks same as the normal one, But the price is very different, baby wipes is more expensive, swindling!\nSolution: In fact, adult wipes and baby wipes are very different in the production process, especially the liquid standard. And the requirements of baby wipes are much higher.\nIn addition, adult wipes usually have a lot of fragrance, while baby wipes are basically odorless or light incense. A large amount of essence will stimulate the baby's skin.\nProblem 4: Good wet tissue must be pure natural and without any chemistry\nOn the network, there are some articles that told you not to choose those wet tissue with preservative  or chemicals. Although only a few mothers look carefully at the ingredients when they are choosing wet tissue, after noting the chemical ingredient, they throw them aside immediately.\nSo-called preservative-free wipes are stunts and never existed!\nFrom the manufacturing process, the wet wipes can immediately breed a lot of bacteria without preservatives and can not be used at all.\nThe most commonly preservative is propylene glycol, which is safe as long as it is in standard range. Some high-end products will replace propylene glycol with butanediol, because the sensitivity of butanediol is lower. In the same way, benzoic acid and benzalkonium chloride can be safe in standard range, too. Pay attention that the toilet wipes can not to be used in the mouth or hands.\nProblem 5: Ignore pH value when choosing baby wipes\nPutting the wet tissue with \"baby wipes\" into shopping cart, no matter what PH value the wipe is.\nSolution: The pH value of the newborn is about 6.5. After six months, it decreases to about 6.0, and after one and a half years old, the baby's pH value is 5.5, nearly same as adult, which is weakly acid.\nAccording to the national standard GBT27728-2011, the PH value between 3.5 to 8.5 is eligible for body wipes. Obviously, the closer you get to the PH of your skin, the less irritating the baby will be and the more comfortable it will be.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Essential household wipes"

Then Mr. Wang combining recent fire cases with gruesome pictures and thought-provoking videos, explained the fire safety knowledge vividly. Sometimes there came out amazing voices, and all staff took out pen and papers to write down the key notes, from here we can see that all of us think highly of this lecture. At last, Mr. Wang introduced the use of fire control facilities and fire extinguishers, which made us have a more intuitive understanding.\n\"The enterprise benefit is important, while fire safety is more important.\" Although the building has perfect fire control system, we still need to pay attention to the safe use of electricity, especially there are lots of non woven fabric in our office, going out without electricity. The lecture improved our fire safety consciousness well, the importance of fire safety education for employees is also a commitment to social responsibility.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: 2017 China international non-woven material exhibition and high-end BBS Hailed a success in Shanghai"

    "text": "You should know - medical nonwoven filter materials\nMedical and health supplies are mostly disposable, such as surgical gown , surgical cap, operation cover, etc. nonwoven materials are not only easy to process and low in cost, but also effective in preventing bacterial transmission and cross infection. Nonwoven filter material as a new type of textile filter material, with the advantage of high efficiency, low cost and price, easily composite with other kinds of nonwoven filter materials, and easy to pleat, fold and mold in the production line.\nThe filter material made of non-woven fiber net has good moisture absorption and permeability because of many pores and less surface hairiness, and is superior to the antibacterial property of the traditional gauze, and is not easy to be infected with the wound adhesion of human body. Therefore, nonwoven filter materials are widely used in the field of medical and health care.\nInfluence Factors\n1 Nonwoven material structure\nThe research shows that the smaller the porosity of non-woven fabric, the greater the fiber filling rate, the stronger the particle interference, the higher the particle capture efficiency, the higher the efficiency of the material filter.\n2 Particle size and shape\nThe size and shape of the particles affect the filtration efficiency of the filter materials. Particle size from big to small, diffusion efficiency is gradually increased, the particle with larger size will be deposited on the fiber because of the interception. Similarly, smaller particles will be deposited on the fiber due to diffusion.\n3 Temperature and humidity\nThe filter material mainly depends on Brown diffusion, interception, inertial collision, gravity deposition and other mechanical functions to filter the particles in the air. The changes of temperature and humidity affect the degree of particle diffusion.\nApplication field\nWith the development and application of filtering materials in various countries, the development of medical non-woven fabric filter material is growing rapidly, At present, they are mainly divided into liquid filtration materials and air filtration materials.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Prevent the fire from now on - fire training"

    "text": "In-depth analysis of global industrial cleaning wipes market trends and opportunities\nIn-depth analysis of global industrial cleaning wipes market trends and opportunities (Based on market research and technology competition analysis in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific) Global market status: growth drivers and regional differentiation 1. Market size and growth rate The global industrial cleaning wipes market will reach $18 billion in 2024 and is expected to increase to $27 billion in 2030 at a CAGR of 6%. The core driving forces are manufacturing automation upgrades, stricter environmental regulations, and accelerated industrialization in emerging markets. Regional perspective: North America: The market size is expected to reach $5.5 billion in 2025, accounting for 30% of the global share, dominated by automotive and electronics manufacturing demand, 3M, Kimberly-Clark Brands such as K consolidate their position through anti-static wipes and high-precision dust-free products Europe: Affected by the EU's \"Single-Use Plastics Directive\" (SUP), the demand for degradable wipes has surged. The German automotive manufacturing industry consumes more than 200,000 tons of wipes annually, and the growth rate of environmentally friendly products has reached 12% Asia Pacific: The growth rate of the Indian and Southeast Asian markets leads the world (10%-15%), but the high-end market is still dominated by Japanese and Korean companies. Toray's nanofiber wipes have a market share of more than 40% in the semiconductor field Competitive landscape and brand strategy International giants: 3M has achieved a market share of 35% in the North American electronics manufacturing industry through the \"technology patent + customization\" strategy; Eagle Group has reduced costs by 30% with a closed-loop recycling system to seize the European environmental protection market. Local breakthrough: India's Filantro First has entered the Southeast Asian food processing chain through bamboo fiber wipes, with prices 25% lower than European and American brands; China's Sinopec's brand has achieved import substitution in the petrochemical field with corrosion-resistant wipes. Technology trend: Dual revolution of environmental protection and intelligence 1. Material innovation Bio-based materials: The degradation cycle of polylactic acid (PLA) wipes has been shortened to 90 days, and the EU market penetration rate has increased from 12% in 2020 to 28% in 2024 Nanotechnology: The nano-coated wipes developed by Japan's Toray can absorb 0.1μm particles, improve cleaning efficiency by 50%, and the repurchase rate of semiconductor customers has reached 85% 2. Intelligent production and functions IoT wipes: Germany's Karcher launched RFID chip embedded wipes, which monitor the number of uses and cleanliness in real time and reduce 20% of consumable waste AI flexible production line: Berry Global in the United States uses AI slitting system, which increases order response speed by 50% and supports fragmented demand with a minimum order of 1 ton Regional market in-depth insights and strategic recommendations 1. North American market: high-end and compliance Pain points: Automakers face California AB 1276 Act, requiring a 50% reduction in VOC emissions from wipes Opportunities: Promote water-based solvent wipes (VOC content <50g/L) and UL ECOLOGO certified products, and bind Tesla, GM and other supply chains. 2. European market: Green premium and circular economy Policy dividends: Wipes that meet EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) can receive a 15%-20% EU procurement subsidy Case: Tork in the Netherlands launched 100% recycled PET wipes. After passing GRS certification, its procurement share in companies such as IKEA and Philips increased to 30%. 3. Emerging markets: cost optimization and localization Southeast Asia: Jointly launch economical wipes with a gram weight of 30-50g/m² with local distributors Middle East: Develop high-temperature resistant (200℃) wipes for the oil industry, and build a joint laboratory with Aramco to shorten the certification cycle. Enterprise competition strategy and investment hotspots 1. Construction of technical barriers Patent layout: Focus on applying for flushable structures (such as EDANA SPD standard) and antibacterial coating patents to intercept imitation products M&A cooperation: Refer to Berry Global's acquisition of Glatfelter, integrate spunlace nonwovens and wiping technology, and shorten the R&D cycle. 2. Channel and service system Digital marketing: Establish an online selection tool, enter the industry and stain type to match the wipe parameters, and increase the conversion rate by 40% After-sales value-added: Provide waste recycling services (such as a cash back of US$50 per ton of wipes) to enhance customer stickiness. Risk warning and future outlook 1. Supply chain risk The Russian-Ukrainian conflict caused the European polypropylene price to fluctuate by more than 25%. It is recommended to set up backup production capacity in Mexico/Eastern Europe. 2. Threat of technological substitution Laser cleaning technology has a 5% replacement rate for metal industry wipes. It is necessary to accelerate the development of \"wipes + detergent\" integrated solutions It is expected that by 2030, the proportion of green wipes will exceed 50%, and the penetration rate of smart wipes in the automotive and semiconductor fields will exceed 30%. Enterprises need to plan bio-based material production lines and data service capabilities in advance\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Tariff surge:spunlace industry breakthrough strategy-Updated March 27, 2025"

    "title": "How are flushable wet wipes made -",
    "text": "How are flushable wet wipes made? Full process explanation\nWet wipes are common daily necessities in people's daily lives. While bringing convenience to people's lives, they also cause various environmental problems. As people's living standards continue to improve, the consumption of wet wipes will continue to rise. Therefore, it is urgent to study a new type of wet wipes product that can be directly flushed and decomposed by throwing it into the toilet after use. Flushable wet wipes refer to wet wipes products that can be easily dispersed, dissolved and degraded in water. The advent of flushable wet wipes has largely solved the waste disposal and environmental pollution problems caused by wet wipes, and can be better applied to usage scenarios and meet the current municipal sewage standards and requirements. So, what is the production process of flushable wet wipes? 1. Material selection Flushable wet wipes generally choose flushable materials, such as natural cellulose, regenerated cellulose fiber, etc. Natural cellulose includes wood pulp fiber, hemp, cotton fiber, etc. Among them, the most commonly used material is wood pulp fiber, which has good flushing performance and degradability, can be quickly dissolved in water, and reduces the impact on the environment. Regenerated cellulose fiber is a fiber obtained by treating and spinning natural fibers through a certain chemical process. It is also called artificial fiber, including viscose fiber, bamboo fiber, lyocell fiber, etc. In order to make wet wipes have good dispersibility, the pulp fiber content should be high during the production process of wet wipes. 2. Fiber preparation The selected materials are treated and processed, such as crushing, cleaning, etc., to obtain a suitable fiber form. The commonly used process is to prepare the raw materials into fibers through cellulose swelling and screening. Flushable wet wipes have certain requirements on the length of the fiber. Long fibers can keep the wet wipes in a certain wet state strength, but when the wet wipes enter the water, the fibers are entangled and hugged with each other, and it is difficult to disperse well in the water. When short fibers with a length of less than 80 mm are formed, there are fewer entanglement points between the fibers, and it is easier to disperse in water. Therefore, when making flushable non-woven materials, it is necessary to balance the wet state strength and flushability, and choose a suitable ratio for production. 3. Fiber reinforcement Fiber reinforcement technology is an important step after web formation. It is used to reinforce the fiber web to improve its strength and durability. Common reinforcement methods include thermal bonding, chemical bonding and spunlace reinforcement. Thermal bonding is to reinforce and bond the fibers by heating; chemical bonding is to use specific adhesives, and its safety should be considered when using it; spunlace reinforcement is to reinforce the fiber web by high-pressure water flow. Compared with the other two methods, the products produced are softer and safer. 4. Functional treatment In the production process of flushable wet wipes, functional treatment is often used to increase the practicality and comfort of flushable wet wipes. The following are some common functional treatment methods. (1) Gentle treatment: Wet wipes will come into contact with the skin, so they need to be gently treated so that they will not irritate the skin. This can be achieved by selecting mild materials and adding mild ingredients. (2) Antibacterial treatment: Wet toilet paper needs to have antibacterial function to avoid bacterial growth. This can be achieved by adding antimicrobial agents or using materials with natural antimicrobial properties. (3) Moisturizing treatment: Wet toilet wipes can provide additional moisturizing and hydrating effects by adding moisturizers to prevent skin dryness. (4) Enhanced cleaning effect: Toilet wipes can enhance the cleaning effect by adding detergents or detergents to enable them to better remove dirt and grease. The choice of functional treatment should be determined based on the purpose of use and user needs. In addition, when performing functional treatment, it is also necessary to ensure safety of use and compliance with relevant regulations and standards.\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: How to ensure the embossing quality of spunlace nonwovens?

In particular, the European Union has been one of the tops all over the world in terms of plastic pollution control. Up to now, 23 countries within the European Union have legislated or taken actions on SUP (Single Use Plastics) directive. In addition , the European Unions ’ single use plastics directive will be set to go into effect, which has put the pressure on wipes and hygiene products manufacturing industries. These products are on the first list of products subject to regulations and labeling requirements.An reduction in plastic-based fibers will lead to increases in the use of both natural and man-made cellulosic fibers which offer benefits such as biodegradability and contribute to the goal of e nvironmental protection and sustainable development.\nAnother aspect of promoting the development of biodegradable materials is consumer s ’ choice s. Consumers always make choices about product qualities that are important to them. They pay more attention to materials that enter and touch the body . Is the product environmentally friendly? Is it safe to use on our skin? A nd natural materials tend to be safer and healthier. This also drives the demand for more natural materials. As nonwoven industry professional manufacturers , we use these information to chose a direction about materials and techniques in developing our products. What materials we use is one of the biggest factors will have greatly influenced that we can choose. Choosing a fiber which is eco-friendly and hypoallergenic is not only good for environment, but also helps keep persons safe and healthy.\nBased on these reasons that driven by combined forces of global plastics legislation, strong consumer preferences and some other factors, demands of biodegradable fibers will be set for rapid growth in the future a s the supplier s of spunlace nonwoven fabric manufacturing .\nViscose is a higher cost performance choice among all biodegradable fibers in the field of spunlace nonwoven fabric manufacturing. People may be a little unfamiliar with viscose ， But because of the natural properties like absorbency, softness and skin-friendliness, viscose fibers have been playing an important role in the hygiene sector for many years, and increasing demand for environmentally friendly solutions has made them even more important. In addition to their natural properties, viscose offer flexibility to customize to the specific requirements of the special nonwoven fabric. Although a synthetic fiber, viscose offers sustainability qualities in nonwovens applications.\nAs the general public demands more recycled content in the nonwoven fabrics they buy, spunlace nonwoven manufacturers are looking for solutions which are sustainable.

The maximum line density of the fiber is 4 ~ 6dtex.\nIn addition, the increase of fiber stiffness and the decrease of specific surface area will hinder the spunlace process. On the contrary, fibrillation and coarse fiber cracking will enhance the bonding effect.\nThere is no limit to fiber length, and the length of fiber used is 20 - 60mm.\nWater jet:\nThe diameter of the holes are range normally from 0.08 to 0.25, but the maximum cases the hole size is either 0.12 or 0.18.\nDensity of jets: 10 – 30 jets/cm\nJet diameter: 80 – 800 mm\nPressure inside the jet manifold: 25-60 MPa\nVelocity of water jet: 10 – 350 m/s\nWater:\nContains almost no particulate matter, is low in metallic ions such s Ca, contains bacteria or other microorganisms.\nWater with neutral pH does not damage the surface of the jet.\nWater of certain temperature can reduce fiber bending moment, making fiber entangle  better.\nSpunlace Nonwoven Process Description\nThe web which is formed usually by means of air-laid or wet-laid process is initially compressed and then pre-wetted to remove air pockets and then only water-needled. The water pressure usually increases from the first to the last injectors. Generally, there is a thumb rule for pressure, and it is as high as 2200 psi, used to direct the water jets on top of the web. This pressure is more than enough for most of nonwoven fibers, even though higher pressures are also being used in some specialized end use.\nThe high-pressure jet of water does the entanglement of the fibres in the web. The jets tire out most of the kinetic energy\nPrimarily in rearranging fibers inside the web\nSecondly, during bounce back against the substrates, dissipating energy to the fibers.\nA vacuum inside the roll take out used water from the product, which prevent from flooding of the reduction in the effectiveness of the jets to cause entanglement.\nGenerally, hydro-entanglement is functional on both sides in a stepwise approach. Now the first entanglement roll active on the first side a number of times in order to impart to the web the desired amount of bonding and strength. The web then passes over a second entanglement roll in an overturn direction in order to treat and consolidate the other side of the fabric.\nThe fabric is then passed through a dewatering machine where surplus water is detached and being dried.\nThe characteristics of spunlace non woven fabric\nExcellent lint-free\nExcellent process-ability\nExcellent strength to weight ratio\nGood Drape-ability\nGood absorbency\nGood strengths\nHigh density\nHigh Elongation-to-break\nStability to heat and chemicals\nVery even surface\nDurable fabrics\nPrintability\nApplication of spunlace non woven fabric:\nSpunlaced fabrics have a broad use in a variety of applications due to comparatively high absorption abilities and no binders in the fabric allowing sterilization of the fabric at high temperatures.\nWipes:\nBaby Wipes\nHousehold Wipes\nIndustrial Wipes\nKitchen wipes\nFace mask sheets\nCosmetic Cotton wool pads\nHospital use:\nSurgical gowns\nSurgical drapes\nOperation cover sheets\nPrevious article: Automatic Blanket Wash Cloth: Clean Faster, Print Better, Save More\nNext article: Two times cleaning effect - this cotton wool pads can do it"
