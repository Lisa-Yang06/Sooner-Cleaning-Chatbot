Non-woven fabrics have different thicknesses and advantages. In order to accurately calculate the price of non-woven fabrics, it is generally necessary to accurately calculate the gram weight of non-woven fabrics. Calculation method of gram weight of non-woven fabrics Gram weight refers to the gram weight per square meter, that is, grams/square meter. 68gsm cloth refers to 68 grams/square meter, which means that the weight of one square meter is 68 grams, which is used to measure and distinguish the thickness of the fabric. Gram weight is used to calculate the thickness of non-woven products. Why not use millimeters? In fact, millimeters are also used, but they are rarely used. This is an industry rule for easy calculation. In fact, square weight is equivalent to millimeters in thickness. The regular weight of non-woven fabrics is between 10g/㎡ and 320g/㎡. Some needle-punched fabrics can achieve thicker weights. In addition to non-woven fabrics, the calculation methods of other Oxford bags, nylon bags, cotton bags, and canvas bags a",

To calculate the weight of non-woven fabrics, there are special measuring tools, cutters and electronic scales in the industry. The measurement method is as follows: 1. Cut a small piece of non-woven fabric and fold it in half several times; 2. Use a cutting tool to cut out pieces of cloth of the same size (round or square); 3. Weigh the weight of each piece, add the total weight and divide it by the quantity (this is more uniform and accurate); Due to the non-woven fabric industry, the production process and technology of each factory are different, and the weight produced is biased. For example, if the order specification is 70gsm, not every piece will be exactly 70gsm after weighing. Generally, we try to control it within the gram weight deviation range allowed by the industry. Depending on the material and thickness of different types of non-woven fabrics, the gram weight of non-woven fabrics is also different. Each non-woven fabric manufacturer has similar calculation methods for the gram weight of different types of non-woven fabrics.",

    "text": "Compared to traditional materials such as cotton yarn and rags, non-woven wipes are reshaping industrial cleaning standards with technological innovation: 1. Cleaning efficiency revolution Water and oil absorption: Non-woven fabrics have a liquid absorption rate 2-3 times that of traditional wipes. For example, microfiber cloth can absorb 10 times its own weight of oil, while cotton cloth can only absorb 3 times. Decontamination ability: Special embossed design (such as honeycomb pattern) increases the cleaning contact area by 40%, and can penetrate 0.1mm gaps to remove particles. 2. Hygiene and safety upgrade Antibacterial performance: Medical-grade non-woven fabrics have passed ISO 10993 biocompatibility certification, with bacterial residues <100 CFU/g, while traditional wipes have a bacterial content of more than 1 million CFU/g after one week of use. Cross-contamination: Disposable non-woven fabrics are disposable, avoiding the risk of pathogen transmission caused by repeated use. 3. Economic breakthrough Service life: High-strength polyester non-woven fabric can be reused more than 50 times, while the average service life of cotton fabric is only 10 times. Comprehensive cost: After a certain automobile factory switched to non-woven fabric, the annual cleaning consumables cost dropped by 28%, and the manual cleaning time was reduced by 40%. 4.

Scene adaptation capability Smart device compatibility: The high-density flow-guiding layer design is adapted to the automatic towel dispensing machine, 1 roll of non-woven fabric = the traditional 3 rolls, and 200+ commercial projects have been implemented. Customized service: Supports flexible customization of weight (35-130gsm), width (10-320cm), and embossed texture, and proofing can be completed in 3 days. 6. Global certification endorsement International standards: Passed INDA/EDANA GD4, OEKO-TEX and other certifications, meeting the cross-border procurement requirements of Amazon, Walmart and other companies.

INDA (North American Nonwovens Association) and EDANA (European Nonwovens Association) updated the evaluation method for flushable disposable nonwoven wipes in the Flushability Evaluation Guide (4th Edition) released in 2018. The guide contains a total of 7 flushability evaluation tests to test the flushability and biodegradability of products. Only after passing these 7 tests can it be called a \"flushable product\", which are toilet and sewer clearance test, shaking box decomposition test, household pump test, sedimentation test, aerobic biodegradation/biodegradation test, anaerobic biodegradation/biodegradation test, and municipal sewage pump test. 1. Toilet and sewer clearance test Used to detect whether the wet wipes can be flushed down the toilet and whether there is a possibility of clogging the toilet and sewer. The test system consists of a toilet and a sewer pipe, simulating a family of four using the toilet normally for 2 consecutive days and at least 3 times a day, and flushing the toilet 35 times in the order of flushing only water, flushing only wet wipes, and flushing wet wipes and simulated feces. The condition for passing this test is that the distance between the center of mass of the additive should not continue to decrease when flushing for 5 consecutive times without using other tools such as toilet plungers. 2.",

The specific operation is as follows: First, place the non-woven wet wipes sample in a shaking box filled with 2 L of tap water. After shaking at a certain frequency and amplitude for 60 minutes, transfer the sample to a porous sieve with an aperture of 12.5 mm, collect the sample left on the porous sieve and weigh it, and calculate the percentage of the dry weight ratio of the sample on the sieve to the original sample. The condition for passing this test is that in the sample test, at least 5 samples have a decomposition rate greater than 70%. China's new flushability test for disposable sanitary nonwoven materials stipulates that the dry cloth shakes in a shaking box for 10 minutes, and the decomposition rate level exceeds 90%; the wet wipes shake in a shaking box for 60 minutes, and the decomposition rate level exceeds 70%. 3. Household pump test It is used to test whether wet wipes will have an impact on household sewage pumps and sewage systems. The test consists of a toilet, a sewer pipe and a sewage pump.

During the preparation process, attention should be paid to controlling the moisture content and moisture content of wet wipes, adding an appropriate amount of wet moisturizer, etc., to improve the stability and use experience of the product. When selecting materials, choose biodegradable materials and process the materials into a fiber state, which can be done through textile technology, spinning technology, etc.; you can use wet-laid or dry-laid technology to prepare the materials into fibers yarn. Wet laying includes three stages: dispersing fiber raw materials, fiber web shaping and drying. During production, the fibers are first dissolved in water according to a certain proportion, then beaten into a slurry with a beater, and then the slurry is evenly distributed. Apply it on the mesh curtain and dry it to form a fiber mesh. Fibers suitable for wet-laid webs are required to have good dispersion in water.

The dispersibility of fibers in water is affected by factors such as their aspect ratio, curl, and hygroscopicity. To improve the dispersion rate of fibers in water, surfactants can be added to water for hydrophilic treatment. Dry-laid webs include carded webs and air-laid webs. The carded web-laid method has higher fiber length requirements, while the production of wet wipes requires a certain content of short fibers to maintain its flushability. The product is not highly dispersible and will be gradually eliminated from the market. The airlaid method does not have high requirements on the length of long fibers and can be used to process short fibers with a length less than 80 mm, especially wood pulp fibers with a length less than 10 mm, and has the advantage of relatively low production costs. The fibers produced by the above method also need to go through the reinforcement process to keep the wet wipes in good wet strength. The reinforcement mainly includes chemical bonding, thermal bonding, and spunlace. The chemical bonding method is to coat a layer of reinforcing agent on the surface. The reinforcing agent can be a water-soluble polymer, adhesive or resin, etc., which forms a thin film by coating and drying, thereby increasing the strength and stability of the wet wipes.

So, where are the safety risks of spunlace non-woven fabrics, the raw materials of wet wipes, roughly from? 1. Residual toxic and harmful substances in the raw materials of wet wipes base fabrics In addition to natural fibers such as cotton fibers, organic solvents or heavy metal ion aqueous solutions are used in the production and processing of non-natural fibers such as regenerated cellulose fibers commonly used in wet wipes base fabrics.

The fabric obtained after this reinforcement is spunlace nonwovens. The principle of reinforcing the fiber web by spunlace is similar to the needle punching process, but instead of using needles, multiple fine water jets generated by high pressure are used - spunlace machines spray the fiber web. After the water jet passes through the fiber web, it is supported by the rebound of the net curtain and interspersed with the fiber web again. As a result, the fibers in the fiber web are displaced, interspersed, entangled and embraced under the hydraulic action of high-speed water jets interspersed in different directions, so that the fiber web is reinforced. So what are the common patterns of spunlace nonwovens?

It just arranges polypropylene, polyester and other fiber materials directed or randomly to form a fiber net structure, and then uses mechanical ， chemical or thermal bonding methods to reinforce them. Simply speaking, it is the bonding of fibers directly together, but it’s not interwoven and knit together by yarns. Therefore, when we get the nonwoven fabric, we will find that it has no warp and weft threads, and the thread residues can not be drawn out. It is easier to cut, sew and shape. Nonwoven fabric has the characteristics of short process flow, wide source of raw materials, fast production rate, low cost, high output, multiple product types, and wide application. It can also be made into cloths with different thickness, hand feeling and hardness ccording to requirements. Nonwoven fabric not only breaks through the traditional textile principle, but also provides a lot of convenience for our lives.",

More than any other product we sell, it's these amazing little cloths designed to use with toner and quite honestly, anything that you would normally use with a cotton ball. So I thought I would do a visual comparison so you can see for yourself why these Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads are such a sought-after product. Here's how they are different from cotton balls and cotton wool pads (rounds or squares). Ultra thin for less product waste. As you can see from the photo, they are certainly much thinner than cotton balls, but even a lot thinner than a cotton wool pad. So why does this benefit you? Well, this means that you have less product waste so you save money. You’ll use about 75% less product than a cotton ball and about 40% less from a cotton pad…",

Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads stay put in your fingers and are easy to manage. No fuzz or shredding cotton fibers. Since Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads is not 100% cotton, they don't leave fuzz everywhere when applied to the face. This makes cotton wool pads ideal for contact lens wearers who can't get any anything in their eyes and for men with facial hair that don't want to leave any white cotton behind on their skin. Extremely gentle on the skin. Cotton fibers can feel scratchy and irritating on thin, sensitive skins, but not our Single-layer Cotton Wool Pads. They feel very soft and gentle when they glide across the skin. Simply put, you'll never go back to cotton again.

Mothers often worry about baby allergies, especially after buying new diapers, when the baby shows a red butt, mothers immediately conclude that these diapers must be fakes, and demand for returns strongly. But the red butt may not be caused by diapers, but the wet tissues . Now, let's take a look at the things you should pay attention to when choosing baby wipes. Problem 1: It is good wet tissues with a large amount of liquid Wet tissue with a large amount of liquid can remove impurities better, and eliminating the tedious process of cleaning with clean water. Excessive liquid can easily breed bacteria, and less liquid has a bad effect on cleaning. A good wet tissue should has a moderate humidity, and liquit of each slice is suitable for use at one time.",

Problem 2: More thicker more better The thick wet tissue is not easily to rip, and it can be used many times,  which also can absorb more liquid. Solution: There is no relationship between thickness and pulling property, but the material is the key factors that if it can be torn off easily or not. Baby's skin is very sensitive, and too thick and hard wet tissue may cause skin damage and irritation. Moderate thickness and soft baby wipes can be a good choice. Problem 3: There is no differences among these wet tissues, why not pick one casually? The wet tissue with \"baby\" looks same as the normal one, But the price is very different, baby wipes is more expensive, swindling!",

In addition, adult wipes usually have a lot of fragrance, while baby wipes are basically odorless or light incense. A large amount of essence will stimulate the baby's skin. Problem 4: Good wet tissue must be pure natural and without any chemistry On the network, there are some articles that told you not to choose those wet tissue with preservative  or chemicals. Although only a few mothers look carefully at the ingredients when they are choosing wet tissue, after noting the chemical ingredient, they throw them aside immediately.

Some high-end products will replace propylene glycol with butanediol, because the sensitivity of butanediol is lower. In the same way, benzoic acid and benzalkonium chloride can be safe in standard range, too. Pay attention that the toilet wipes can not to be used in the mouth or hands. Problem 5: Ignore pH value when choosing baby wipes Putting the wet tissue with \"baby wipes\" into shopping cart, no matter what PH value the wipe is. Solution: The pH value of the newborn is about 6.5. After six months, it decreases to about 6.0, and after one and a half years old, the baby's pH value is 5.5, nearly same as adult, which is weakly acid. According to the national standard GBT27728-2011, the PH value between 3.5 to 8.5 is eligible for body wipes. Obviously, the closer you get to the PH of your skin, the less irritating the baby will be and the more comfortable it will be.

As people's living standards continue to improve, the consumption of wet wipes will continue to rise. Therefore, it is urgent to study a new type of wet wipes product that can be directly flushed and decomposed by throwing it into the toilet after use. Flushable wet wipes refer to wet wipes products that can be easily dispersed, dissolved and degraded in water. The advent of flushable wet wipes has largely solved the waste disposal and environmental pollution problems caused by wet wipes, and can be better applied to usage scenarios and meet the current municipal sewage standards and requirements. So, what is the production process of flushable wet wipes? 1. Material selection Flushable wet wipes generally choose flushable materials, such as natural cellulose, regenerated cellulose fiber, etc. Natural cellulose includes wood pulp fiber, hemp, cotton fiber, etc. Among them, the most commonly used material is wood pulp fiber, which has good flushing performance and degradability, can be quickly dissolved in water, and reduces the impact on the environment. Regenerated cellulose fiber is a fiber obtained by treating and spinning natural fibers through a certain chemical process. It is also called artificial fiber, including v",

Fiber preparation The selected materials are treated and processed, such as crushing, cleaning, etc., to obtain a suitable fiber form. The commonly used process is to prepare the raw materials into fibers through cellulose swelling and screening. Flushable wet wipes have certain requirements on the length of the fiber. Long fibers can keep the wet wipes in a certain wet state strength, but when the wet wipes enter the water, the fibers are entangled and hugged with each other, and it is difficult to disperse well in the water. When short fibers with a length of less than 80 mm are formed, there are fewer entanglement points between the fibers, and it is easier to disperse in water. Therefore, when making flushable non-woven materials, it is necessary to balance the wet state strength and flushability, and choose a suitable ratio for production. 3. Fiber reinforcement Fiber reinforcement technology is an important step after web formation. It is used to reinforce the fiber web to improve its strength and durability. Common reinforcement methods include thermal bonding, chemical bonding and spunlace reinforcement. Thermal bonding is to reinforce and bond the fibers by heating; chemical bonding is",

Functional treatment In the production process of flushable wet wipes, functional treatment is often used to increase the practicality and comfort of flushable wet wipes. The following are some common functional treatment methods. (1) Gentle treatment: Wet wipes will come into contact with the skin, so they need to be gently treated so that they will not irritate the skin. This can be achieved by selecting mild materials and adding mild ingredients. (2) Antibacterial treatment: Wet toilet paper needs to have antibacterial function to avoid bacterial growth. This can be achieved by adding antimicrobial agents or using materials with natural antimicrobial properties. (3) Moisturizing treatment: Wet toilet wipes can provide additional moisturizing and hydrating effects by adding moisturizers to prevent skin dryness. (4) Enhanced cleaning effect: Toilet wipes can enhance the cleaning effect by adding detergents or detergents to enable them to better remove dirt and grease. The choice of functional treatment should be determined based on the purpose of use and user needs. In addition, when performing functional treatment, it is also necessary",

The maximum line density of the fiber is 4 ~ 6dtex. In addition, the increase of fiber stiffness and the decrease of specific surface area will hinder the spunlace process. On the contrary, fibrillation and coarse fiber cracking will enhance the bonding effect. There is no limit to fiber length, and the length of fiber used is 20 - 60mm.

The water pressure usually increases from the first to the last injectors. Generally, there is a thumb rule for pressure, and it is as high as 2200 psi, used to direct the water jets on top of the web. This pressure is more than enough for most of nonwoven fibers, even though higher pressures are also being used in some specialized end use.
